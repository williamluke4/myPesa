# myPesa
## Info
Works by looking for messages from `MPESA` then parses them using regex. I am not a flutter dev, was just experimenting and **Safaricom** don't provide a nice way to view transactions.

## Help Wanted
If there is anyone who wants to help out with this please feel free to submit issues or PRs :) 

## Installation
  - [Go to Releases](https://github.com/williamluke4/myPesa/releases) and download the latest `.apk` under assets.
  - After installation you may have to close the app after initially opening it to get it to work.
